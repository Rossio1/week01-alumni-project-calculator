## My OOP Calculator
**Tech Used:** HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript

The objective of this project is to build an OOP concept calculator. I built a class called Calculator with a add, subtract, multiply and divide method that accepted two paramters, `val1` and `val2` and returned that to our method called which is stored in the variable answer. How this is possible is attaching an event listener to each of our buttons. When the buttons are clicked on we run a function that pulls the name of the button and with a condition statement we run the respective method.

## Lesson Learned

I learned to create an instance of the class called `calc` to access the class Calculator methods. Also when to appropiate use a constructor, which in this case is not needed because there is no need for storing data. We only need to call on the methods.

## Optimization

Still a work in progress.
